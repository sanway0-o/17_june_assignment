    "**Q1.** In Python, the `try` and `except` blocks are used for error handling and exception handling. They play a crucial role in managing and gracefully dealing with exceptions and errors that might occur during program execution. Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `try` Block:\n",
    "   - The `try` block is used to enclose a section of code where you anticipate that exceptions or errors might occur.\n",
    "   - It allows you to specify a portion of your code that should be monitored for exceptions.\n",
    "   - If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and Python looks for an associated `except` block to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `except` Block:\n",
    "   - The `except` block is used to define how to handle specific types of exceptions that might be raised within the associated `try` block.\n",
    "   - When an exception occurs in the `try` block, Python searches for a matching `except` block that can handle that type of exception.\n",
    "   - If a matching `except` block is found, the code within that block is executed, and then the program continues running from the point immediately after the `try-except` construct.\n",
    "   - If no matching `except` block is found, the exception propagates up the call stack, potentially leading to program termination or triggering a more global exception handler if one is defined.\n",

    "a. `EOFError` (End of File Error):\n",
    "   - This error occurs when an operation involving file input or standard input (`input()` function) reaches the end of a file or input stream unexpectedly, and no more data is available to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. `FloatingPointError`:\n",
    "   - `FloatingPointError` occurs when there is an issue with floating-point arithmetic, such as attempting to perform an operation that results in an undefined or non-representable floating-point value, like dividing by zero in floating-point math.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. `IndexError`:\n",
    "   - `IndexError` is raised when you try to access an index in a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) that is outside the valid range of indices. It typically occurs when trying to access an element with an index that is too large or too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. `MemoryError`:\n",
    "   - A `MemoryError` is raised when your program runs out of available memory (RAM) while trying to allocate memory for a new object, such as a list, dictionary, or other data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. `OverflowError`:\n",
    "   - `OverflowError` occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that exceeds the limits of the data type. For example, trying to represent an extremely large integer that exceeds the maximum allowed value for the data type will raise this error.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. `TabError`:\n",
    "   - `TabError` is raised when there is an issue with the indentation of code using tabs and spaces inconsistently. It typically occurs when mixing tabs and spaces for indentation in the same code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "g. `ValueError`:\n",
    "   - `ValueError` is a general-purpose exception that is raised when an operation or function receives an argument of the correct type but with an inappropriate or invalid value. It can occur in various contexts, such as type conversion or function arguments.\n",
